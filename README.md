## 📌 Abstract

This project implements a resource-efficient, noise-robust quantum-classical hybrid solver for the 1D viscous Burgers’ Equation — a nonlinear PDE that models convective steepening and viscous diffusion. Leveraging recent advances in quantum PDE frameworks, the solution explores two novel approaches:

- Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) for velocity field compression via Matrix Product States  
- Hydrodynamic Schrödinger Equation (HSE) formulation for fluid evolution using wavefunction dynamics

The project demonstrates proof-of-concept simulations, compares classical and quantum outputs, and analyzes resource scaling, noise tolerance, and hardware viability.

## 🔍 Motivation

Classical CFD solvers face increasing resource bottlenecks for high-resolution, nonlinear PDEs. Quantum computing offers a promising path forward through exponential state-space compression and polynomial speedups. This project tackles:

- Solving 1D Burgers’ Equation — a canonical benchmark retaining the nonlinear and viscous core of Navier-Stokes  
- Implementing quantum time-evolution circuits that satisfy divergence-free and compressible fluid constraints  
- Designing algorithms compatible with error-mitigated or early fault-tolerant quantum hardware
